1. Customer Service Window:
    - Whenever someone messages a business on WhatsApp, a 24-hour timer starts (or refreshes, if one has already started).
    - Within the window, the support bot may reply with both template and free-form messages.
    - Outside the window, the support bot may reply with only template messages.
    - (Template messages have to be verified by Meta. Eg. of a template message: hello_world)
1. Consent:
    - Business-initiated conversations must obtain individual customer consent. 
    - The opt-in notification must state that the person agrees to receive messages from the business through WhatsApp. 
    - You also need to include the name of the business. 
1. Automation:
    - You can use automation to respond during the 24-hour customer service window.
    - You must give the recipient a prompt, clear and direct method for escalating to a live agent.
1. Limits:
    - Business phone numbers are initially limited to 250 business-initiated conversations in a 24-hour moving period.
    - You can increase your messaging limit to 1,000 on your own.

## WhatsApp API Tips

### Messaging

1. Use free-form messages during customer service windows whenever possible, since these types of messages have the least restrictions.
